      Well that’s too bad. But the bills don’t pay themselves, especially with the rent so high here! Why did you get this job anyway?

Dialogue with principal:

| Hello there, [mispelling of name], and welcome to Cannon H.S. As this year’s principal, let me tell you how this is going to work. |
| --- |
| We here at Cannon are dedicated to making a safe and amazing learning environment for our pupils and thus, have installed cameras around the school to ensure everything runs smoothly. |
| Your job is to catch bad pupils who disrupt our learning environment. |
| You’ll be working here: |
| This is the camera. You can click on students and our advanced facial recognition software will identify potential matches. |
| Here you can switch camera views. |
| Here you can see our smoke detectors. These are designed to catch smoke from some newfangled “smile smokers” that kids have been using in the bathrooms. |
| And here is the directory, where you can see a student’s schedule and potential call them into the office for searching. |

## Gameplay

- Drugs
  - 3 designated drug dealers will accumulate vapes as time goes on. Every day, a student might pass a vape to a friend based on drug chance and connection, and will bring some of their vapes to school. They might also have a list of students that owe them money.
  - SHOWN BY: Smoke detectors going off in the bathrooms with students in them.
  - FALSE POSITIVES: Multiple people in the bathroom; the player must wait until the detector stops going off to see who really was vaping.
  - SPECIAL: Bargaining with the drug dealers will lead to them offering to pay you money to distribute the drugs for them. This means for an income you’ll have to suspend students only for bullying / disobedience.
- Disobedience
  - 3 students creating and passing posters similar to drugs.
  - SHOWN BY: Illegal posters. You have a list of valid posters and if you see an invalid one, you have to send someone out to check it.
  - FALSE POSITIVES: The posters will be very pixelated on the camera view, so it’ll be unclear if it’s valid or not.
  - SPECIAL: See the bargaining above; idk how we can make the tech guy help the anti-I movement tho.
- Bullying
  - If bullying continues, someone gets hurt and you get in trouble. (This is really just a distraction for the other stuff happening)
  - You have to suspend all students involved because zero-tolerance.
  - SHOWN BY: Students getting into fights.
- Scoring mechanics
  - Endings:
    - Lose (Broke): The player doesn’t suspend enough and is forced to leave due to a lack of money.
    - Lose (Fired): The player suspends too many wrong people and gets fired after pressure from parents.
    - True neutral: The player just plays the game boringly and lasts 30 days; the player keeps their job.
    - Leader: The player helps the students, the old administration is ousted, I is removed, and everyone is happy.
    - Brainwashed: The player suspends the anti-I students, and eventually everyone forgets about being mad about I and becomes indoctrinated.
    - Promotion: The player suspends all the drug dealers who are expelled, and the player gets a promotion to the district level. (Note that this could be seen as good or bad depending on the player’s actions to the anti-I students).
    - Dealer: The player helps the drug dealers, which is implied to be bad.
    - Leader + Promotion is true good ending while Brainwashed + Dealer is true bad.
- Tools: See cocnept designs.

# Suspension

- Scoring mechanics
  - Student Appeal
    - If low: Students act out, more suspensions.
    - Reflected in student conversations and amount of delinquencies.
  - Staff Appeal
    - If high: Pay raise, more expectations and suspensions.
    - Reflected in emails.
  - Endings
    - __Promoted__ (Last 30 days): You are moved to a better school with a better pay.
    - __Hated__ (0 student appeal): The school is pressured to fire you and they do.
    - __Demoted__ (0 student appeal, high staff appeal): You are moved to a job with less student interaction.
    - __Fired__ (0 staff appeal): The school fires you.
    - __Respected__ (0 staff appeal, high student appeal): The students protest your firing. You don’t have as much money but at least you were well-liked.
  - Scoring metrics: Total money earned, total profit, number of correct suspensions for each reason, suspension accuracy, days lasted, end student appeal, end staff appeal.

  - Attributes: Each will also have a susceptibility factor to favor a larger spread of delinquencies.
    - Drugs: Also impacted by how many students already vape. Will go into bathrooms during class and lunch to do so.
