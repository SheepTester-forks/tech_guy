# Suspension

- Scoring mechanics
  - Student Appeal
    - If low: Students act out, more suspensions.
    - Reflected in student conversations and amount of delinquencies.
  - Staff Appeal
    - If high: Pay raise, more expectations and suspensions.
    - Reflected in emails.
  - Endings
    - __Promoted__ (Last 30 days): You are moved to a better school with a better pay.
    - __Hated__ (0 student appeal): The school is pressured to fire you and they do.
    - __Demoted__ (0 student appeal, high staff appeal): You are moved to a job with less student interaction.
    - __Fired__ (0 staff appeal): The school fires you.
    - __Respected__ (0 staff appeal, high student appeal): The students protest your firing. You don’t have as much money but at least you were well-liked.
  - Scoring metrics: Total money earned, total profit, number of correct suspensions for each reason, suspension accuracy, days lasted, end student appeal, end staff appeal.

- Suspension
  - Can happen to anyone at any time for any reason.
  - Earns salary per.
  - Reasons (__must select it!__)
    - Drugs (vaping & weed): Student appeal lowered, staff appeal raised.
    - Politics (critical forum posts): Student appeal lowered significantly, staff appeal raised significantly.
    - Violence
      - If only the aggressor is suspended, student appeal is raised. In any other situation (victim & aggressor, just the victim, or none at all) student appeal is lowered.
    - If a student is suspended wrongly, student appeal lowers significantly.
- Students
  - Attributes: Each will also have a susceptibility factor to favor a larger spread of delinquencies.
    - Drugs: Also impacted by how many students already vape. Will go into bathrooms during class and lunch to do so.
    - Politics: Students disagree when appeal is low. Will post more critical things on the forum and talk about it.
    - Violence: Increased chance if drugs. Will randomly attack others during lunch.
